## Objective Project Components :clipboard: :
  - Purpose of the project: Why did you start the project.
  - Objective: What you accomplished.
  - Approach: How you accomplished it.
  - Project duration: How long it took you.
  - Your role: How you contributed to the team or project.
  - Final product overview: Pictures, videos, links, etc.


## Finished Projecks  :white_check_mark: :

  - Linux Arch rice (virtual)
    - See resources and the bare github repo [cfg](https://github.com/Horsekey/cfg)
      - Still need to upload dot files to cfg
    - Arch Linux with i3-gaps, alacritty, ranger, rofi, polybar, cava, ncspot (mpd & ncmpcpp), and pywal
  
  - ARP Spoof
      - Lab was really informative and showed the basics of ettercap
      - Need to see what other types of MITM attacks it can do

  - RDP Setup
    - With limited resources (no server/VPN) to establish a secure RDP connection, I opted to use Google's remote desktop solution
    - Delivered to business with documentation in the "RDP-Projek" folder

  - NAS File server
    - Utilized TrueNAS 12.0-U8.1 to make a NAS with Raidz2 and Windows share authentication (Samba and Microsoft account).
    - Had issues with authentication and upkeep of the machine. Used an older box that had limited RAM, will upgrade with time!
